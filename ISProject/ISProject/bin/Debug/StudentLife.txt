	Escuela de Brigida Montessori Inc. embraces the day student population and believes 
that it is an important component of the community. Each individual can play a key role 
enriching and being enriched by school community. The most successful students at the school 
have fully involved themselves in the life of the school.
	The students are encouraged to stay for meals and get involved in formal and informal 
free-time activities at the school. The students may better integrate into the community and 
experience all the school has to offer by staying at the school longer than classes and 
sports require.
