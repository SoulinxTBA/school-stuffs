Safety and school security

1. Physical safety
- Essential to keep the school environment including the school buildings, premises, laboratories, computer rooms, libraries, toilets, drinking water facilities, transport area, school buses, and the surrounding safe and secure.,
- The buildings should be built to ensure "life safety", and be more resilient to hazards.
- School administration, staff, teachers as well as students to be better aware and be prepared to respond to any catastrophe, natural or man-made.

2. Psychological safety
- The schools must leverage low cost and environment-friendly technologies without compromising on structural soundness and safety of the buildings.

3. Background verification of staff
- When it comes to hiring teachers, administrators, and other school staff, there are many good reasons to conduct pre-employment backgrounds checks for student safety.
- Will help schools in screening people who comre in contact with students within the school premises, including teachers, administrators, sports coaches, cleaninf staff and volunteers.

4. Visitor management system
- Generic tags for visitors and handwritten late slips and permission for students will not really serve the purpose of recording and analysing information.
- A school can easily collate information from contactors, volunteers, parents, and staff visits during the signs-in/sign-out process.
